## Active Patterns
<!-- Current, verified patterns used by this agent -->

### Responsibilities
- PRD creation (greenfield + brownfield)
- Epic creation and management
- Product strategy and roadmap

### Epic Orchestration

- State tracked in `.aiox/epic-{epicId}-state.yaml`
- Wave-based parallel execution

### Delegation
- Story creation → @sm (`*draft`)
- Course correction → @aiox-master (`*correct-course`)
- Deep research → @analyst (`*research`)

### Bob Mode (user_profile=bob)
- PM acts as orchestrator when `user_profile: bob`

- Session state persistence in `.aiox/bob-session/`

### Key Locations
- PRD: `docs/prd/` (sharded)
- Epics: `docs/stories/epics/`
- Templates: `.aiox-core/development/templates/`
